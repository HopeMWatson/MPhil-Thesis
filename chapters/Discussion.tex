\subsection{Property of Disorder}
The LD matrix in the simulation was artificial, in that the points of high LD "blocks" and low LD "hotspots" were very symmetric. This is not found in actual parts of the genome. Therefore the behaviour between disorder and number of SNPs is not as perfectly linear. This was proven by running the analysis without a seed.

\section{Further Research}
The next step in this research is to apply the disorder term to credible sets. By applying the disorder term, a smaller credible set can be obtained in most circumstances. Certain scenarios such as small odds ratios between 1.0-1.1, shown to actually report undercoverage instead of overcoverage, should be used with caution. In such a scenario utilising the disorder term will be extraneous and unnecessarily complicate the analysis.
